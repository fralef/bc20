										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that Twitter and micro-blogging in general have properties that could be exploited along with broadcasting services. I’ll write my thoughts about this later on.</p>
<p>As a first step in this reflexion, I’d like to estimate the total bandwidth of Twitter, that is, how many kilobits per second are being Tweeted on average.</p>
<p>I made a similar exercise some time ago with regards to the blogosphere in a post titled “<a href="http://www.broadcasting20.org/2006/03/13/broadcasting-the-blogosphere-30-million-voices-for-the-price-of-one-2/">Broadcasting the Blogosphere: 30 million voices for the price of one!</a>”.</p>
<p>So I found some twitter services that provide relevant data. For example, <a href="http://www.tweespeed.com/speeds.jsp?period=hour&amp;duration=168">TweeSpeed</a> is an instant speed meter that shows the current number of tweets per minute. A graph showing the speed per hour during the last week is also available. A quick look at that graph now suggests that 700.000 tweets per hour would be a reasonable approximation for last week’s average, excluding the peek caused by the “Michael Jackson Effect”. <a href="http://www.twitpocalypse.com/">Twitpocalypse</a> currently reports 221 tweets per second which results in a similar value (221*60*60 =795.600 tweets per hour ). On another front, the recent HubSpot <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/Portals/249/sotwitter09.pdf">State of the Twittershpere</a> report provides similar amounts on a daily basis instead of per hour. I suspect that this is a mistake. I’ll be pessimistic and take the largest number. The Hubspot report also informs on the distribution of actual tweet length. I’ll average the tweet length to 110 characters per tweet.</p>
<p>So the math goes like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">110ch * 1byte/ch * 700k/hour = 77 Mbytes/hour</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">or</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="5"><span style="font-size: 18px;">TOTAL TWITTER BANDWIDTH = 170 kbps !</span></font></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
  Again, very surprising results! The current Twitter bandwidth is barely higher than a typical Internet or DAB radio station. The whole Twittershpere would only require to sacrifice a couple of off-air DAB stations in every market. I feel that very innovative datacasting/social applications could be built based on this!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last three days at the new <a href="http://www.videoonthenet.com/">video track</a> of the VON conference which has been dealing with <a href="http://www.von.com/">Voice On the Net</a> for the last ten years. As we know, video on the net is currently gaining ground on a daily basis with Youtube, Google Video, video blogging and many other passionate artists, producers and and so on. That&#8217;s the reason why video was inserted in the VON program this year and I realize that video on the net will probably face regulatory issues that VOIP had to go through in the recent years: intellectual property, copyright protection and network neutrality just to name a few. In fact, Jeff Pulver is being proactive on that issue by launching the <a href="http://www.videoonthenet.org/web/index.php">Video On the Net Alliance</a> to advocate for this emerging Internet video industry.</p>
<p>Voice over IP is disruptive. The flexibility provided by VOIP is an important factor for its success, but its impact is also quite important in that it opened the telecommunication playing field to new players that can operate outside the grasp of the incumbent telecommunication industry. Jeff Pulver officially stated that VOIP, an industry he triggered, is now well established. &#8220;We are now the incumbents who can be disrupted&#8221;.</p>
<p>In that respect, video on the net will allow the same type of disruption. Broadcasters and broadcast regulation can (and will) be circumvented by people and organizations who see the Net as an effective distribution platform.</p>
<p>Does Skype ring a bell? Well, they could potentially be #1 in both spaces. But that&#8217;s the topic of my next post.</p>
