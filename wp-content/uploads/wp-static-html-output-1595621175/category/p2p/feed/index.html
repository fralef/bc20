										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year <a href="http://www.broadcasting20.org/2006/02/05/super-bowl-and-broadcasting/">I reported</a> that the Superbowl was not available off the Net. After my <a href="http://www.broadcasting20.org/2006/07/05/p2p-broadcasting/">positive experiment</a> last summer with the soccer WorldCup 2006, I knew I should be able to access a live peer-to-peer stream of the Superbowl somehow. Well, thanks to Technorati and <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#038;friendID=154387936&#038;blogID=226025505&#038;MyToken=bd7e2058-36cc-45c4-880f-2903833476e9">this post</a> at The Frog Blog, I was watching the show live within a minute.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img alt="Notebook vs TV" title="Notebook vs TV" src="http://www.broadcasting20.org/wp-content/2007_02_04_superbowl2.jpg" /></div>
<p>Here you see the two live scenes I could watch simultaneously earlier tonight;  a wifi notebook with the P2P <a href="http://www.tvunetworks.com/">TVUPlayer</a> software and my plain old 36&#8243; tube. I observed a one minute latency on the notebook.<br />
Like the WorldCup on TVAnts, the stream robustness was impressive. Once it got started, the stream simply never stopped. Its data rate fluctuated between 350 and 400 kbps.  This is not great video quality but when that&#8217;s the only signal you have access to, it&#8217;s far better than nothing. For myself, I was happy to see the original CBS Superbowl commercials live for the first time. Here in Canada, the original commercials are always &#8220;Canadianized&#8221; by the local networks except on some pricy pay TV services.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img title="TVU Player" alt="TVU Player" src="http://www.broadcasting20.org/wp-content/2007_02_04_superbowl1.jpg" /></div>
<p>So overall, it looks like P2P streaming works well. However, TVU Networks statistics would be required in order to really be able to assess what&#8217;s going on here. Also, I don&#8217;t know at this point if TVU is a pure P2P solution of if they rely on additional servers or CDNs to provide critical capacity.</p>
<p>Although I find these new P2P developpments very exciting,  the real new trend in the States this year was certainly HD TV. With their new HD wide screens, sports fans got closer to mother nature this year; they could enjoy and observe each and every raindrop that fell on the field in Miami Gardens!</p>
