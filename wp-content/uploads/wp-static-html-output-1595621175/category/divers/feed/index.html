										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never had a good memory for proverbs and quotes. However, this one (in bold below) by &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Heine">Heinrich Heine</a>&#8221; stuck in my mind when I heard it some 15 years ago while visiting north Germany (Wikipedia excerpt):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the thousands of books burned on Berlin&#8217;s Opernplatz in 1933, following the Nazi raid on the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, were works by Heinrich Heine. To commemorate the terrible event, one of the most famous lines of Heine&#8217;s 1821 play Almansor was engraved in the ground at the site: <strong><em>&#8220;Dort, wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man am Ende auch Menschen.&#8221; (&#8220;Where they burn books, they will ultimately also burn people.&#8221;)</em></strong> In the original text, Heine had been referring to the burning of the Quran during the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out a way to express the same idea but in relation to the Internet and the fact that it is being <a href="http://dpi.priv.gc.ca/">deep packet inspected</a> and throttled and filtered and fire-walled. I&#8217;m not so sure I figured it out yet but I came up with this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Where they destroy packets, they will ultimately also destroy people&#8221;</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like it. Any ideas on how to improve it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I&#8217;m just back to my hotel, looking on the blogosphere for some &#8220;early&#8221; analysis of the opening keynotes tonight. Only 2 posts on Technorati by now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div> Because I must say I did not catch much of Bruce Sterling&#8217;s talk about &#8220;The Internet of Things&#8221;. Well, all I got is that it will happen in 30 years from now. We can&#8217;t name it today because we&#8217;re just in the middle of it. We (the ETECH crowd) can&#8217;t name it because we&#8217;re to close and too tech oriented to see the big picture. We only see the tech side of it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&#8220;The Internet of Things&#8221;&nbsp;is not Web 2.0 because Web 2.0 is today. Web 2.0 formulates new mechanisms by which Web 1.0 guys can exploit new web stuff (I&#8217;m not so sure Mr. O&#8217;reilly&nbsp;appreciated this statement?).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understood that &#8220;The Internet of Things&#8221; will be about searching, linking, ranking, sorting,&#8230; these entities he calls spimes: objects that are traceable in space and time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now I need to understand what all this really means. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find some great analysis tomorrow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the other hand, I found that the two organizers keynotes (Rael Dornfest and Tim O&#8217;Reilly) were not as punchy as last year. They repeated a lot of stuff for the new crowd (at least half of the attendees). They also did not focus much on the theme &#8220;Attention&#8221; which I did expect. Also a bit surprising that the main opening keynote was not related to this theme.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&#8217;m still looking forward for tomorrow&#8217;s great line of speakers.</div>

					<description><![CDATA[In french there is this expression &#8220;m&#233;li-m&#233;lo&#8221; that&#160;means something like a&#160;mish-mash,&#160;a mess or&#160;a mix. &#160; Well I think I observed some pattern in &#8220;mixing&#8221; letters&#160;together to get a brand for a mobile media service. Have a look at these brands: Melodeo :&#160;music service &#8220;integrator&#8221; for wireless operators Modeo: Cowncastle mobile TV service for the US [&#8230;]]]></description>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Well I think I observed some pattern in &#8220;mixing&#8221; letters&nbsp;together to get a brand for a mobile media service. Have a look at these brands:</div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.melodeo.com/">Melodeo</a> :&nbsp;music service   &#8220;integrator&#8221; for wireless operators</li>
<li><a href="http://www.modeo.com/">Modeo</a>: Cowncastle mobile TV service   for the US based on DVB-H</li>
<li><a href="http://www.btplc.com/News/Articles/ShowArticle.cfm?ArticleID=d8f981cc-2b40-4b07-ac0d-84d341e38c34">Movio</a>:   BT mobile TV service based on DAB</li>
</ul>
<p>I should get the following trademarks: Mevio, Medeo, Molideo,&nbsp;my MeliMelo of course and why not Osolemio !!!</p>
