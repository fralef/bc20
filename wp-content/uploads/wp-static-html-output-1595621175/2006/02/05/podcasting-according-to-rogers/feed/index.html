					<description><![CDATA[I am a big podcasting fan. Even though I _love_ the media I cannot see myself pay 5$ month + data fees for something I can get for free. I have to sync and charge my iPod anyway.
The point of podcasting is the time-shifting. If the content that you are after is so time sensitive that you need it right now while on the go then why are you listening to a podcast an not some broadcast media?

But the bottom line is really cost. GIve it for free and with decent data download charges and then we will talk]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Stan for your &quot;insider&quot; comment. I agree with you that these frequently published podcasts (mostly news I suppose) will fit well to your model. However I think that they will compete for user&#039;s attention against the pre-downloaded podcasts.

Also, PC-synching (with wires) is not that convenient I must admit. I guess that soon our personal device will sync directly to the Net wirelessly (bluetooth, wifi,...) when I&#039;m at home , office or any other &quot;broadband pitstop&quot;.  This will make the whole synching quite transparent to the user. Then, my device will always be filled with great content... and I may not even notice!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To the point of benefit vs. downloading to a PC and synching - a number of mass media podcasts are being updated mulitple times per day.  If you wait until you are in front of your PC you&#039;ll miss an update.  Add that there&#039;s something to be said for immediate gratification.

In terms of batter power I listen daily on both a Sony Ericsson z520a and a Nokia 6620.  I stream 2-4 podcasts of around 5 mins each to my phone, and make/receive the same number of voice calls I always have.  I don&#039;t charge my batteries that much more than before Mobilcast.  Of course mileage may vary.

The one thing you didn&#039;t mention but bears calling out is that performance varies based on signal strength.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good point, I hadn&#039;t thought of file transfer. I&#039;m still not sure it would be a huge hit on the batteries - if it&#039;s like my USB 1.0 player its 3 - 4 minutes of &#039;talk&#039; time for 40 minutes of file playing.

					<description><![CDATA[Peter,

Cell batteries may be more powerful but you have to take into account that you will require battery power for the file transfer, which requires to turn the RF components on for a while. This, I suspect, requires more juice that just playback.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[People who like the convenience of having one device will probably like it - especially if the device is smart enought to pause the podcast audio while you&#039;re on the phome.

I doubt that it would make much a hit on the batteries - most MP3 players are getting better than 10 hours of play out of a AAA and cell battaries are lot more powerful than that.

Still I take your point that Rogers will have a hard time keeping up with the number of podcasts comming out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Yikes, this stuff is moving fast. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rogers Wireless has just announced a deal with Melodeo to drop more than 1,500 podcasts into the cell phones of its subscribers. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The catalogue of podcasts will updated throughout the day as new feeds are received, bringing fresh content to subscribers continually. The &#8220;Rogers Podcast Service&#8221; can be accessed within the GET INFO category on cell phones. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike terrestrial radio, though, it won&#8217;t be free. It&#8217;ll cost subscribers $5 per month. But then subscribers can download their choice of podcasts for immediate listening, and save the ones they want to play again later on their phone.
