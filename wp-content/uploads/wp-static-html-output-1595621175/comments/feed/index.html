					<description><![CDATA[Try using Shoutcast..... I think there is a need for free public wifi infrastructure... revenue would have to be collected from advertisers and broadcasters not the listeners. The problem is bandwidth and the fact that wifi frequencies are narrow and microwave data signals don&#039;t travel the way vhf frequencies do. Most providers are not capable of handling this project mostly due to its risky nature not to mention fcc and government intervention and enormous costs to set up. We are sill far behind, eventually we will get there but there are many questions that arise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[CastingWords.com now charge $ 2,50 per minute for delivery within 24 hours. That&#039;s considerably steeper than 42 (euro?) cents a minute.

Totally agree with your problem description, though. In order to search, scan or mix parts of audio content, we sorely need transcripts and annotations.

My example: I listened to this great interview on Tech Nation the other day, and I would really like to quote parts of that conversation on my blog and elsewhere. I would also love to have a transcript in my archive or perhaps on  a service like Evernote so that it would come up in future search results from my own &quot;stuff&quot;.
(http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4460.html)

If I was interviewed on Tech Nation - or if I was the broadcaster - I would make damn sure to provide transcripts. Not only would it be a great service to listeners of the show; it would also be a great asset for search optimization and findability.

Apparently there is fairly decent speech-to-text software on the market (http://lifehacker.com/230009/call-for-help-podcast-to-transcript).

I&#039;ve been wondering why there isn&#039;t an open source software project addressing this need. Or is there?]]></description>
