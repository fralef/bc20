										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a nice <a href="http://www.publicradioplayer.org/?p=544">post</a> on the <a href="http://www.publicradioplayer.org/">Public Radio Player (PRP) blog</a> about some challenges for Internet radio when distributed over mobile wireless networks and some strategies used in the PRP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A dropped stream is the nemesis of any regular Public Radio Tuner user. Nothing is worse than being caught up in a great public radio program and have it suddenly cut out&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some challenges can be expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>loss of signal while roaming from cell to cell. Networks are optimized for voice calls but not for data yet.</li>
<li>minimal bitrate like 32 kbps is desirable but connection is still not guaranteed and sound quality is no great</li>
<li>buffers have to be implemented in receiver to mitigate signal loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results of a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/167391/a_day_in_the_life_of_3g.html">survey made by PC World</a> suggest that 3G coverage may not be adequate for the delivery of sustained bitrates in major cities in USA. Like <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/zoom?id=167391&amp;page=1&amp;zoomIdx=1">this table shows</a>, networks speeds can be impressive but their reliability vary greatly so that live radio transmissions may be hard to achieve.</p>
<p>There is certainly a lot of room for experimentation here in this new area but I tend to believe that it could take a while before we see 3G replace true &#8220;physical layer&#8221; broadcast networks for live transmissions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/vodafone-launches-home-3g-femtocell-in-the-uk-1203">this article</a>, Vodafone will be next week the first mobile network operator to launch a femtocell product in Europe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Looking like a home router, femtocells give 3G coverage indoors, and use home broadband to connect calls across the Internet to the mobile network.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; will be available on different price plans&#8230; Essentially, the femto is free to anyone on a £30 contract, and £5 otherwise &#8211; including dongle customers&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Femtocells are in fact compact devices (similar to Wi-Fi routers) that act as very low power cell phone base stations that can be installed in end-users premises. Typical cell phones can connect to them instead of the remote &#8220;high-power&#8221; towers operated by mobile network operators. Femtocells carry the usual communication services through standard Internet connections in homes and offices.</p>
<p>Key benefits to operators (O) and users (U):</p>
<ul>
<li>Better in-building coverage (O, U)</li>
<li>Overall network infrastructure can eventually be operated at lower power levels (O)</li>
<li>Off-loading cellular networks (O)</li>
<li>MNOs can still charge service costs while using end-users resources (Internet) (O)</li>
<li>Use the mobile device at home at lower rates (U)</li>
<li>Does not need regular phone service at home anymore (O, U)</li>
</ul>
<p>Could this femtocell approach be exploited in the context of digital broadcasting as well? At CRC, we have developed a <a href="http://mmbtools.crc.ca/">compact software transmitter for DAB</a>. This platform could be further integrated as a low-cost personal DAB transmitter or FemtoDAB cell!</p>
<p>Such a FemtoDAB approach could offer interesting benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better in-building coverage (O, U)</li>
<li>Overall network infrastructure can eventually be operated at lower power levels (O)</li>
<li>Outdoor, indoor roaming with the same device (broadcast enabled handhelds) (U)</li>
<li>Transmission of additional Internet radio content in the femtoDAB cell (U)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the challenges will be to make FemtoDAB more attractive than the Wi-Fi options.</p>
<p>Do you see any use cases for FemtoDAB?</p>
<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Internet radio appliances are becoming available, there is still the issue that they can&#8217;t be used in your car.</p>
<p>This could change thanks to so-called &#8220;in-car WiFi routers&#8221; which are designed to provide Internet access through 3G mobile telephony networks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.autonetmobile.com/">AutoNet Mobile</a> offers such device and service combination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we create a Wi-Fi hot spot that allows everyone in the car to connect multiple devices to the internet, in and around the car! it’s the next step in in-car entertainment and productvity. we make internet in your car easier than ever because we provide both the in-car router and the monthly service. our affordable monthly service plans start at only $29 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still represent an expensive proposition for radio though. One hour daily consumption of good quality Internet radio content could easily reach the 29$ 1Gb limit.</p>
