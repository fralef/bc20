					<description><![CDATA[CastingWords.com now charge $ 2,50 per minute for delivery within 24 hours. That&#039;s considerably steeper than 42 (euro?) cents a minute.

Totally agree with your problem description, though. In order to search, scan or mix parts of audio content, we sorely need transcripts and annotations.

My example: I listened to this great interview on Tech Nation the other day, and I would really like to quote parts of that conversation on my blog and elsewhere. I would also love to have a transcript in my archive or perhaps on  a service like Evernote so that it would come up in future search results from my own &quot;stuff&quot;.
(http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4460.html)

If I was interviewed on Tech Nation - or if I was the broadcaster - I would make damn sure to provide transcripts. Not only would it be a great service to listeners of the show; it would also be a great asset for search optimization and findability.

Apparently there is fairly decent speech-to-text software on the market (http://lifehacker.com/230009/call-for-help-podcast-to-transcript).

I&#039;ve been wondering why there isn&#039;t an open source software project addressing this need. Or is there?]]></description>
