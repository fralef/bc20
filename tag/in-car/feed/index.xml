										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new receiver is always good news for an emerging technology like DAB.</p>
<p>A more interesting aspect of this launch though is the context that made it possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digibnetwork.com/">DigiBnetwork</a>, a commercial broadcaster in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta">Malta</a>, convinced a manufacturer to produce a new DIN car receiver. DigiBnetwork went as far as to create and own this new &#8220;bluestate&#8221; brand. DigiBnetworks now sells the receiver through EBay and its website. This, in a sense, represents a &#8220;verticalized&#8221; business model as DigiBnetwork has control over a whole DAB ecosystem: content, network, receivers. We typically know this type of control from mobile communications operators.</p>
<p>I find this development quite exciting because it shows that even a small country like Malta can influence new developments in consumer electronics. With this development, it looks like the huge economies of scale and size of markets are not required anymore to justify the production of new devices. This is something we&#8217;ve been saying for a few years now with our <a href="http://openmokast.org/">Openmokast</a> project which we hoped would catalyze the emergence of broadcast smart phones MADE BY BROADCASTERS.</p>
<p>The &#8220;bluestate&#8221; car receiver seems to be a step in this direction. Congratulations DigiBnetwork!</p>
<p>Lets see now who comes up with the first broadcaster-led smart phone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Internet radio appliances are becoming available, there is still the issue that they can&#8217;t be used in your car.</p>
<p>This could change thanks to so-called &#8220;in-car WiFi routers&#8221; which are designed to provide Internet access through 3G mobile telephony networks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.autonetmobile.com/">AutoNet Mobile</a> offers such device and service combination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we create a Wi-Fi hot spot that allows everyone in the car to connect multiple devices to the internet, in and around the car! itâ€™s the next step in in-car entertainment and productvity. we make internet in your car easier than ever because we provide both the in-car router and the monthly service. our affordable monthly service plans start at only $29 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still represent an expensive proposition for radio though. One hour daily consumption of good quality Internet radio content could easily reach the 29$ 1Gb limit.</p>
