<p>I don&#8217;t know but it makes great sense to me. I would love to see a CBC / Radio-Canada device like this. CBC/RC have great Internet offerings but they tend to &#8220;capture&#8221; the audience into their branded web portals. Because of this, many CBC/RC Internet radio streams are not accessible through Internet appliances other than full fledged PC&#8217;s. A branded device seems to be a good compromise to escape the PC prison.</p>
<p>Another very promising effect of this device is that it will help fund NPR&#8217;s programming since they will collect a portion of the proceeds. What an original way to fund public broadcasters!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/vodafone-launches-home-3g-femtocell-in-the-uk-1203">this article</a>, Vodafone will be next week the first mobile network operator to launch a femtocell product in Europe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Looking like a home router, femtocells give 3G coverage indoors, and use home broadband to connect calls across the Internet to the mobile network.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; will be available on different price plans&#8230; Essentially, the femto is free to anyone on a £30 contract, and £5 otherwise &#8211; including dongle customers&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Femtocells are in fact compact devices (similar to Wi-Fi routers) that act as very low power cell phone base stations that can be installed in end-users premises. Typical cell phones can connect to them instead of the remote &#8220;high-power&#8221; towers operated by mobile network operators. Femtocells carry the usual communication services through standard Internet connections in homes and offices.</p>
<p>Key benefits to operators (O) and users (U):</p>
<ul>
<li>Better in-building coverage (O, U)</li>
<li>Overall network infrastructure can eventually be operated at lower power levels (O)</li>
<li>Off-loading cellular networks (O)</li>
<li>MNOs can still charge service costs while using end-users resources (Internet) (O)</li>
<li>Use the mobile device at home at lower rates (U)</li>
<li>Does not need regular phone service at home anymore (O, U)</li>
</ul>
<p>Could this femtocell approach be exploited in the context of digital broadcasting as well? At CRC, we have developed a <a href="http://mmbtools.crc.ca/">compact software transmitter for DAB</a>. This platform could be further integrated as a low-cost personal DAB transmitter or FemtoDAB cell!</p>
<p>Such a FemtoDAB approach could offer interesting benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better in-building coverage (O, U)</li>
<li>Overall network infrastructure can eventually be operated at lower power levels (O)</li>
<li>Outdoor, indoor roaming with the same device (broadcast enabled handhelds) (U)</li>
<li>Transmission of additional Internet radio content in the femtoDAB cell (U)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the challenges will be to make FemtoDAB more attractive than the Wi-Fi options.</p>
<p>Do you see any use cases for FemtoDAB?</p>
<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The current financial context is not optimal for deploying new broadcast networks. Some will tend to think twice on how to maximize the use of the current infrastructure.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that the case with FM radio? Will it truly benefit from going digital?</p>
<p>One of the compromise I find attractive is starting to emerge: enabling mobile phone handsets to receive FM AND RDS. Such an effort led by GSS and Silicon Laboratiroes is reported <a href="http://www.radioworld.com/article/79114">here</a> at RadioWorld.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GSS believes that cell phones that can receive FM without cumbersome headphone antennas will not only be more popular with consumers but can then put RDS capabilities into the hands of many more consumers, which in turn will better support the penetration of emergency alerting systems like its <a href="http://www.alertfm.com/">Alert FM</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last three days at the new <a href="http://www.videoonthenet.com/">video track</a> of the VON conference which has been dealing with <a href="http://www.von.com/">Voice On the Net</a> for the last ten years. As we know, video on the net is currently gaining ground on a daily basis with Youtube, Google Video, video blogging and many other passionate artists, producers and and so on. That&#8217;s the reason why video was inserted in the VON program this year and I realize that video on the net will probably face regulatory issues that VOIP had to go through in the recent years: intellectual property, copyright protection and network neutrality just to name a few. In fact, Jeff Pulver is being proactive on that issue by launching the <a href="http://www.videoonthenet.org/web/index.php">Video On the Net Alliance</a> to advocate for this emerging Internet video industry.</p>
<p>Voice over IP is disruptive. The flexibility provided by VOIP is an important factor for its success, but its impact is also quite important in that it opened the telecommunication playing field to new players that can operate outside the grasp of the incumbent telecommunication industry. Jeff Pulver officially stated that VOIP, an industry he triggered, is now well established. &#8220;We are now the incumbents who can be disrupted&#8221;.</p>
<p>In that respect, video on the net will allow the same type of disruption. Broadcasters and broadcast regulation can (and will) be circumvented by people and organizations who see the Net as an effective distribution platform.</p>
<p>Does Skype ring a bell? Well, they could potentially be #1 in both spaces. But that&#8217;s the topic of my next post.</p>

<div>Blogging is still exploding. In his &#8220;state of the blogosphere&#8221; speech last week at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETECH</a>, <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">David Sifry</a>, CEO of the blog indexing web service <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, presented the latest statistics:</div>
<ul>
<li>30.000.000 blogs worldwide</li>
<li>100.000 new blogs are created daily</li>
<li>the blogosphere is 60 times larger than 3 years ago</li>
<li>there are 1.5 million legitimate posts(by humans for humans) per day</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that each post contains 500 characters,&nbsp;no pictures, and that they are&nbsp;posted&nbsp;regularly over time. This would produce a constant bandwidth of:</p>
<p align=center>500ch * 1byte/ch *1.5 million = 750 Mbytes / day</p>
<p align=center>or</p>
<p align=center>70 kbps !</p>
<p align=left>What? The most&nbsp;massive conversation of the world requires only 70 kbps? That&#8217;s less than a single digital broadcasting audio channel! That&#8217;s 30 million voices for the price of one! Let&#8217;s turn the numbers around once again: with 70 kbps we could have each and every Canadian (30 million, all ages!)&nbsp;broadcast one 500 characters message to all other Canadians every 20 days?!?</p>
<p align=left>That&#8217;s impressive. Does that make sense?&nbsp;I think I would agree to trade a local FM station in my area&nbsp;for&nbsp;this new &#8220;Whole Blogosphere Channel&#8221;. Would you?</p>
